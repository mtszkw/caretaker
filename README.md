Simple, standalone program that can be used to schedule your system shutdown, if you want to watch a movie late night,
but you'll most likely fall asleep or if you need to finish some sort of calculations on your computer that'll take some
time and you want your computer to switch off after that.

You could do that thing from your command-line interface using `shutdown` command, but who would do that if you can do the
same with just few clicks of a mouse, especially when Windows shutdown command requires time to be specified in seconds
and you want to turn off your computer in 4 hours and 53 minutes.
